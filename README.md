# NLP-Classification
This repo implements methods for extracting features from text. Two approaches are implemented: 
  * One based on word-embeddings, which [1] describes as a baseline.
  * A statistical n-gram language modeling approach, that estimates the conditional probability of a sentence in a class. 
 
# Toy Example
A toy example is provided, to play around with the provided approaches. 
The dataset used is a randomly selected subset of the "banknote authentication" dataset available at the [UCI Machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication).
