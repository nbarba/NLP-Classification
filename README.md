# NLP-Classification
This repo contains python implementations for extracting features from text, that I have used in my research mostly for user input classification tasks.  
Two approaches are implemented: 
  * One based on word-embeddings, which is described as part of the baseline methods in [1].
  * A typical statistical n-gram language modeling approach, that estimates the conditional probability of a sentence in a class.

# Toy Example
A toy example is provided, to play around with. The dataset used is a randomly selected subset of the "SMS Spam Collection" dataset available at the [UCI Machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).
